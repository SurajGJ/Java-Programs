1. Yes, Abstraction is used to hide the implementation of methods using Interfaces.
	Encapsulation used to ristrict our code to either read only or Wright only or both 
	by using getter and setter methods.

2. Is a relation ships occour only when the Child class is extends to Parent class, and create
	the instance of object in the child class. but in HAS-A relation ship we can establish the 
	connection between two classes by creating the instance of another class, without extending any
	class.

3. Because of Ambiguity, In Multiple Inheritance child class extends two or more parent class, the 
	problem is if the parent class contains same method then Ambiguity is happens. So java doesn't 
	support Multiple Inheritance by class. We can make use of Multiple Inheritance using interfaces.

7. equals() method is refering the object of veriable, where == is refering the address of veriable.

8. By creating Enum class, using Final keyword to the constant Decleration we can create constants 
	in Java.

9. Public : Publi Members can be accsseble by any package in java it has no limits, class, method ,
				constructor can be public.
	Private : Private members is only accessable in the same class, method and constructor And class 
				Can be private, but class cannot have relation Ship with other class.
	Protected : Private members can also accessable in any package but only through the Inheritance.

10. Wrapper class helps us to make our program completely object oriented programing. It come over
	with the concepts of reemoving the primitive datatypes in our programs. It privide some dataype 
	Similar to the primitive datatypes, Wrapper Class datatypes are of Object Level.

11. System.gc() method is used to call Grabage Collector in our program, 
	Runtime.gc() method is used to call Garbage Collector only at the RunTime.

12. * Heap memory can store the Duplicates, stack cannot store any duplicates.
	* Heap objects can be modified, Stack objects cannot be modified.
	* Heap not memory efficent, Stack is momory efficent due to it does not allow any duplicates.
	* Heap is fast compared to Stack, Stack is bit Slow.

14. Marker Interface haing the abstract keyword by default its method members are public staic
	and thus it called as Marker Interface.

15. Final Keyword in Veriables : It is commonly used to declare Constants where the constants canot 
										changed, It make user to declare and intialize in the same line
										it can't offer  you to intialize in further.
	Final keyword in Methods : Method cannot be override, due to final.
	Final KeyWord in class : cannot Inherit.

	* Static is Non access specifiers, final is a keyword.
	* Static members can be use without creation of object, final members accessed only by creating 
		instance of object.
